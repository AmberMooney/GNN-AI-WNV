# GeoAI-Flavivirus Repo
This repo is for sharing code associated with the GeoAI and spatiotemporal epidemiology to forecast flavivirus transmission project. 

# Repo Contents
[HyperParameters.ipynb](HyperParameters.ipynb) : A Jupyter Notebook using KerasTuner to select the best hyper parameters for training a Neural Network designed to predict WNV incidence.

[SpatialAnalysis.ipynb](SpatialAnalysis.ipynb) : A Jupyter Notebook look at techniques such as choropleth maps, scatter plots, and spatial autocorrelation analysis to identify patterns, clusters, and spatial relationships among variables for WNV incidence.

[WNV_Detections.ipynb](WNV Detections.ipynb) : A Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing WNV features and MLP Neural Network WNV detection.
